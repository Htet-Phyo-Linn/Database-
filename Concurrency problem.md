Let's illustrate a simple concurrency problem with a sequence of SQL queries. We'll simulate two transactions that cause a concurrency problem by leading to inconsistent data or a lost update.

### Example of Concurrency Problem: Lost Update

**Setup**: Suppose we have two users trying to update the `Job_Name` of the same employee simultaneously. Without proper locking or transaction isolation, one of the updates might be lost.

#### Initial State

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
```

Assume the output is:

```plaintext
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
| Eno   | Ename     | Gender | Job_Name      | Department|
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
| E0033 | John Smith| Male   | Account Manager| Finance   |
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
```

#### Transaction 1 (Session 1)

1. Start Transaction:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    ```

2. Read the current job name of employee `E0033`:

    ```sql
    SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

    Output: `Account Manager`

3. Update the `Job_Name`:

    ```sql
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'Finance Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

#### Transaction 2 (Session 2)

1. Start Transaction:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    ```

2. Read the current job name of employee `E0033` (before Transaction 1 commits):

    ```sql
    SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

    Output: `Account Manager` (because Transaction 1 hasn't committed yet)

3. Update the `Job_Name`:

    ```sql
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'HR Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

#### Commit Transactions

- **Transaction 1** commits:

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **Transaction 2** commits:

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```

#### Final State

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
```

If both transactions successfully commit, the final state might show:

```plaintext
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+-----------+
| Eno   | Ename     | Gender | Job_Name    | Department|
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+-----------+
| E0033 | John Smith| Male   | HR Manager  | Finance   |
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+-----------+
```

**Problem**: The update made by Transaction 1 (`Finance Manager`) is lost because Transaction 2 overwrote it with `HR Manager`.

### Preventing Concurrency Problems

To prevent this kind of concurrency problem, you can use higher isolation levels or proper locking mechanisms.

#### Using Higher Isolation Levels

Set the isolation level to `SERIALIZABLE` to ensure transactions are executed sequentially:

```sql
-- Set isolation level to SERIALIZABLE for both transactions
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

#### Using Explicit Locks

You can use explicit locking to prevent concurrent updates:

1. **Transaction 1 (Session 1)**:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    -- Lock the row for update
    SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033' FOR UPDATE;
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'Finance Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    COMMIT;
    ```

2. **Transaction 2 (Session 2)**:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    -- This will wait until Transaction 1 commits
    SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033' FOR UPDATE;
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'HR Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    COMMIT;
    ```

By using `FOR UPDATE`, Transaction 2 will wait until Transaction 1 completes, preventing the lost update problem.

### Summary

Concurrency problems, such as lost updates, occur when multiple transactions try to modify the same data simultaneously without proper synchronization. Using higher isolation levels or explicit locking can help mitigate these issues.










### Types

There are several types of concurrency problems that can occur when multiple transactions are executed concurrently without proper isolation or synchronization. Here are the main types:

### 1. Lost Update
Occurs when two transactions read the same data and then update it based on the value read. The final update by one transaction overwrites the update made by the other transaction, resulting in a lost update.

**Example:**
- Transaction 1 reads a value.
- Transaction 2 reads the same value.
- Transaction 1 updates the value.
- Transaction 2 updates the value, overwriting Transaction 1's update.

### 2. Dirty Read
Occurs when a transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed. If the other transaction is rolled back, the data read by the first transaction becomes invalid.

**Example:**
- Transaction 1 updates a value but does not commit.
- Transaction 2 reads the updated (dirty) value.
- Transaction 1 rolls back.
- Transaction 2 has read invalid data.

### 3. Non-Repeatable Read
Occurs when a transaction reads the same row twice and gets different values each time because another transaction has modified the data and committed in between the two reads.

**Example:**
- Transaction 1 reads a value.
- Transaction 2 updates and commits the value.
- Transaction 1 reads the value again and sees the updated value.

### 4. Phantom Read
Occurs when a transaction reads a set of rows that satisfy a condition and, during the transaction, another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that satisfy the same condition. This results in a different set of rows when the first transaction reads the data again.

**Example:**
- Transaction 1 reads a set of rows based on a condition.
- Transaction 2 inserts or deletes rows that match the condition.
- Transaction 1 reads the set of rows again and sees a different set.

### 5. Write Skew
Occurs in a situation where two transactions read overlapping sets of data and then make updates based on the values read. The updates do not conflict directly, but the combined effect of the two transactions violates a business rule.

**Example:**
- Transaction 1 reads row A and row B.
- Transaction 2 reads row A and row B.
- Transaction 1 updates row A based on the value of row B.
- Transaction 2 updates row B based on the value of row A.
- The final state of the database violates some business constraint.

### Preventing Concurrency Problems

Concurrency problems can be mitigated using the following techniques:

1. **Isolation Levels:**
   - **Read Uncommitted:** Allows dirty reads.
   - **Read Committed:** Prevents dirty reads.
   - **Repeatable Read:** Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
   - **Serializable:** Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

2. **Locks:**
   - Use row-level or table-level locks to control access to data.
   - `FOR UPDATE` clause to lock rows that are being read for update.

3. **Optimistic Concurrency Control:**
   - Use versioning to detect and resolve conflicts at commit time.

4. **Pessimistic Concurrency Control:**
   - Lock resources at the beginning of a transaction to prevent other transactions from accessing them until the lock is released.

### Example of Preventing a Dirty Read

Set the transaction isolation level to `READ COMMITTED` to prevent dirty reads:

```sql
-- Set isolation level to READ COMMITTED
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- Transaction 1
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Employee_Records SET Job_Name = 'Finance Manager' WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
-- Do not commit yet

-- Transaction 2
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033'; -- This will not see the uncommitted update from Transaction 1
COMMIT;
```

By understanding these concurrency problems and using appropriate techniques, you can ensure the consistency and integrity of your database even when multiple transactions are executed concurrently.
