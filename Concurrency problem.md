Let's illustrate a simple concurrency problem with a sequence of SQL queries. We'll simulate two transactions that cause a concurrency problem by leading to inconsistent data or a lost update.

### Example of Concurrency Problem: Lost Update

**Setup**: Suppose we have two users trying to update the `Job_Name` of the same employee simultaneously. Without proper locking or transaction isolation, one of the updates might be lost.

#### Initial State

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
```

Assume the output is:

```plaintext
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
| Eno   | Ename     | Gender | Job_Name      | Department|
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
| E0033 | John Smith| Male   | Account Manager| Finance   |
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
```

#### Transaction 1 (Session 1)

1. Start Transaction:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    ```

2. Read the current job name of employee `E0033`:

    ```sql
    SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

    Output: `Account Manager`

3. Update the `Job_Name`:

    ```sql
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'Finance Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

#### Transaction 2 (Session 2)

1. Start Transaction:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    ```

2. Read the current job name of employee `E0033` (before Transaction 1 commits):

    ```sql
    SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

    Output: `Account Manager` (because Transaction 1 hasn't committed yet)

3. Update the `Job_Name`:

    ```sql
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'HR Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

#### Commit Transactions

- **Transaction 1** commits:

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **Transaction 2** commits:

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```

#### Final State

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
```

If both transactions successfully commit, the final state might show:

```plaintext
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+-----------+
| Eno   | Ename     | Gender | Job_Name    | Department|
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+-----------+
| E0033 | John Smith| Male   | HR Manager  | Finance   |
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+-----------+
```

**Problem**: The update made by Transaction 1 (`Finance Manager`) is lost because Transaction 2 overwrote it with `HR Manager`.

### Preventing Concurrency Problems

To prevent this kind of concurrency problem, you can use higher isolation levels or proper locking mechanisms.

#### Using Higher Isolation Levels

Set the isolation level to `SERIALIZABLE` to ensure transactions are executed sequentially:

```sql
-- Set isolation level to SERIALIZABLE for both transactions
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

#### Using Explicit Locks

You can use explicit locking to prevent concurrent updates:

1. **Transaction 1 (Session 1)**:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    -- Lock the row for update
    SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033' FOR UPDATE;
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'Finance Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    COMMIT;
    ```

2. **Transaction 2 (Session 2)**:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    -- This will wait until Transaction 1 commits
    SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033' FOR UPDATE;
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'HR Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    COMMIT;
    ```

By using `FOR UPDATE`, Transaction 2 will wait until Transaction 1 completes, preventing the lost update problem.

### Summary

Concurrency problems, such as lost updates, occur when multiple transactions try to modify the same data simultaneously without proper synchronization. Using higher isolation levels or explicit locking can help mitigate these issues.
