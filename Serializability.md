Serializability is the highest isolation level in database systems, ensuring that transactions are executed in a way that the end result is equivalent to some serial execution of those transactions. This means that even though transactions may be executed concurrently, the final result would be as if the transactions were executed one after the other in some order.

### Example of Serializability with Simple Queries

Let's illustrate serializability with a simple example using your `Employee_Records` table.

#### Initial State

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
```

Assume the output is:

```plaintext
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
| Eno   | Ename     | Gender | Job_Name      | Department|
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
| E0033 | John Smith| Male   | Account Manager| Finance   |
+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+-----------+
```

### Scenario

We have two transactions, Transaction A and Transaction B, that need to update the job name of employee `E0033`.

#### Transaction A (Session 1)

1. Set isolation level to `SERIALIZABLE`:

    ```sql
    SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
    ```

2. Start Transaction:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    ```

3. Read the current job name of employee `E0033`:

    ```sql
    SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

    Output: `Account Manager`

4. Update the `Job_Name`:

    ```sql
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'Finance Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

5. Do not commit yet (simulating a long-running transaction).

#### Transaction B (Session 2)

1. Set isolation level to `SERIALIZABLE`:

    ```sql
    SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
    ```

2. Start Transaction:

    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    ```

3. Try to read the current job name of employee `E0033`:

    ```sql
    SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

    This query will be blocked because Transaction A is still in progress and has not committed its changes.

### Commit Transactions

- **Transaction A** commits:

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **Transaction B** then continues and gets the result of the committed transaction A:

    ```sql
    SELECT Job_Name FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

    Output: `Finance Manager`

4. Update the `Job_Name`:

    ```sql
    UPDATE Employee_Records
    SET Job_Name = 'HR Manager'
    WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
    ```

5. Commit Transaction B:

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```

### Final State

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee_Records WHERE Eno = 'E0033';
```

Output:

```plaintext
+-------+-----------+--------+-----------+-----------+
| Eno   | Ename     | Gender | Job_Name  | Department|
+-------+-----------+--------+-----------+-----------+
| E0033 | John Smith| Male   | HR Manager| Finance   |
+-------+-----------+--------+-----------+-----------+
```

### Explanation

1. **Transaction A** reads the job name and sets it to `Finance Manager` but does not commit immediately.
2. **Transaction B** starts and tries to read the job name, but since Transaction A is not committed, it is blocked until Transaction A completes.
3. Once Transaction A commits, Transaction B can proceed, read the updated job name (`Finance Manager`), and then update it to `HR Manager`.
4. Both transactions are serialized, meaning their final effect is equivalent to them being executed one after the other.

### Summary

Serializability ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other in a way that would result in inconsistent data. By setting the isolation level to `SERIALIZABLE`, you ensure that transactions are executed in a manner that maintains consistency, even though they may be executed concurrently. This prevents issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
